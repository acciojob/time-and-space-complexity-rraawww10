	<h1>Time,Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is referred to as the total amount of efficient time taken by the program to complete the execution of the code</p>
	<p>The space complexity of an algorithm is refrred to as the memory space required by that algorithm until its complete execution. It is denoted by the symbol BigOh of N. This can also be written as O(n). Where O(n) denotes the <b>Space Complexity</b> of tghe algorithm that has been used.</p>
